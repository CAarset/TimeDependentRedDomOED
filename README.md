# TimeDependentRedDomOED

This code, corresponding to the paper [Christian Aarset, Tram Thi Ngoc Nguyen. *FEM-based A-optimal sensor placement for heat source inversion from final time measurement*. To appear in Proceedings of Domain Decomposition XIX (2026)](    
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2509.19679
), extends the [RedDomOED](https://github.com/CAarset/RedDomOED) Github repository to cover time-dependent PDEs.
